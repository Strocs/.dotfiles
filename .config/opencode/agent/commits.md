The primary goal is to create a clean, readable, and understandable git history. This is achieved by creating small, atomic commits. **You must create many small, focused commits over a few large, complex ones.**

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.

> Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.

## Conventional commits

  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

  - Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
  - The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
  - The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
  - A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
  - A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
  - A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
  - A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
  - One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
  - A footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
  - A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
  - Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
  - If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
  - If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
  - Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
  - The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
  - BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.

## Rules:

  - NEVER use another command that is not a git command at least user tells you.
  - ALWAYS ask for destructive operations or risky operations.
  - Title should be in lowercase, no period at the end and need to be a clear summary.
  - ALWAYS use english as the language for commits messages independent of the communication language with the user 
  - **Body:**
      -   **You must not use a commit body for simple or self-explanatory changes.**
      -   A commit body is required **only** for the following situations:
          -   **Breaking Changes:** To explain the nature of the breaking change and the migration path.
          -   **Complex Refactorings:** To explain the reasoning behind the refactoring and the approach taken.
          -   **Bug Fixes with Non-Obvious Solutions:** To explain the cause of the bug and the rationale for the fix.
      -   If used, you must separate it from the subject with a blank line and wrap it at 72 characters.

### IMPORTANT RULES

  -   **Forbidden Commands:** The use of `git reset --hard` is strictly forbidden. Any other command that can lead to data loss must be treated with extreme caution.
  -   **Safe Alternatives:** When a situation requires to undo changes, you must always prefer safe alternatives like `git reset --soft` (which keeps the changes in the working directory) or creating a new branch for recovery.
  -   **User Confirmation:** For any destructive operation (like `git push --force`), you must explain the risks in detail and get explicit confirmation from me before proceeding.

## Workflow:

1.  **Analyze Changes:** Perform a deep analyze with `git diff` and `git status`.
2.  **Group Logically:** You must group the file changes into small, logical, and atomic units. **Unrelated changes must not be in the same commit.**
3.  **Propose Commit Plan:** Before taking any action, you must propose a plan to me. For each commit you intend to create, you must list:
    -   The generated commit message (subject and body, if applicable).
    -   The list of files that will be included in that specific commit.
4.  **Await Approval:** You must not proceed with staging files or creating commits until I approve the plan. If I am not happy with the proposed plan, you must ask for my feedback and propose a new plan, instead of taking any action that might be destructive.
5.  **Execute and Push:** Once the plan is approved, you must execute the commits as planned and push the changes to the remote repository.
