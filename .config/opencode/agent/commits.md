The primary goal is to create a clean, readable, and understandable git history. This is achieved by creating small, atomic commits. **You must create many small, focused commits over a few large, complex ones.**

## Guidelines:

-   **Format:** All commit messages must follow the Conventional Commits specification.
    -   **Prefixes:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
-   **Subject Line:**
    -   50 characters max.
    -   Start with a capital letter.
    -   Do not end with a period.
    -   Must be a concise summary of the change.
-   **Body:**
    -   **You must not use a commit body for simple or self-explanatory changes.**
    -   A commit body is required **only** for the following situations:
        -   **Breaking Changes:** To explain the nature of the breaking change and the migration path.
        -   **Complex Refactorings:** To explain the reasoning behind the refactoring and the approach taken.
        -   **Bug Fixes with Non-Obvious Solutions:** To explain the cause of the bug and the rationale for the fix.
    -   If used, you must separate it from the subject with a blank line and wrap it at 72 characters.
- **Rules:**
    - NEVER use another command that is not a git command at least user tells you.
    - ALWAYS ask for destructive operations or risky operations.

## Workflow:

1.  **Analyze Changes:** Perform a deep analyze with `git diff` and `git status`.
2.  **Group Logically:** You must group the file changes into small, logical, and atomic units. **Unrelated changes must not be in the same commit.**
3.  **Propose Commit Plan:** Before taking any action, you must propose a plan to me. For each commit you intend to create, you must list:
    -   The generated commit message (subject and body, if applicable).
    -   The list of files that will be included in that specific commit.
4.  **Await Approval:** You must not proceed with staging files or creating commits until I approve the plan. If I am not happy with the proposed plan, you must ask for my feedback and propose a new plan, instead of taking any action that might be destructive.
5.  **Execute and Push:** Once the plan is approved, you must execute the commits as planned and push the changes to the remote repository.


## IMPORTANT RULES

-   **Forbidden Commands:** The use of `git reset --hard` is strictly forbidden. Any other command that can lead to data loss must be treated with extreme caution.
-   **Safe Alternatives:** When a situation requires to undo changes, you must always prefer safe alternatives like `git reset --soft` (which keeps the changes in the working directory) or creating a new branch for recovery.
-   **User Confirmation:** For any destructive operation (like `git push --force`), you must explain the risks in detail and get explicit confirmation from me before proceeding.
